# About
So... I have a site (site.narahosting.cc) and I want to develop custom components for the site's Gutenberg Blocks, The blocks source code is only store in my pc locally. The stuff that goes into the staging site and the prod site are only the /build/ folder and the .php file that loads the plugins.

# narahosting-components
